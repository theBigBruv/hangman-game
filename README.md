#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4 - Hangman Game

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
2.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
3.  Alternatively, deploy your application to the Google cloud platform and test out the endpoints
 by visiting the Google API Explorer for your deployed app - link is {App ID}.appspot.com/_ah/api/explorer
 

##Game Description:
This is an improvised version of the traditional Hangman guessing game. Each game begins 
with a single 'target' word of at least 8 alphabets, and a maximum of 10 'wrong letter guesses' 
allowed. The goal is to eventually guess the target word, by guessing the individual letters 
that make up the target word. 'Guesses' are sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply
with either: 'correct letter guess', 'wrong letter guess', 'you win', or 'game over' (which 
signifies a loss, when the maximum number of wrong letter guesses is reached). There is no limit 
the number of correct letter guesses required to complete the target word. A 'final score' is awarded 
at the end of the game, based on the number of wrong letter guesses remaining (maximum 10, minimum 0). 
Many different Hangman games can be played by many different Users at any given time. Each game 
can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter `urlsafe_game_key`.
